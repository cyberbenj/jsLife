# Contributing Guide

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][First PR]

## How to contribute

* Fork the project from the `master` branch and submit a Pull Request (PR)
  * Explain what the PR fixes or improves
  * Screenshots for bonus points
* Use sensible commit messages
  * If your PR fixes a separate issue number, include it in the commit message
* Use a sensible number of commit messages as well
  * e.g. Your PR should not have 100s of commits

## How to add a new localization

* Edit [js/i18n.js](js/i18n.js)
